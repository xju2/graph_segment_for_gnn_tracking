```

### Test
Download the data `python3 download_data.py`. And then `./build/bin/walk_through data/debug_graph.dot`.


### Developer Guide
Install a Python virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install cibuildwheel build twine
```
